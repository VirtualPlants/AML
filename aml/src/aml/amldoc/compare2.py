"""
Compare
	Comparison of vectors.
  Usage
	Compare(vec, vector_distance)	
  Arguments
	vec (vectors),
	vector_distance (vector_distance).
	
  Returned Object
	An object of type distance_matrix is returned.	
  Background
	The type vector_distance implements standardization procedures. The objective of standardization is to avoid the dependence on the variable type (chosen among symbolic, ordinal, numeric and circular) and, for numeric variables, on the choice of the measurement units by converting the original variables to unitless variables.
