Class
	Class of a vertex
  Usage
	Class(v)
  Arguments
	v (VTX) : vertex of the active MTG
  Returned Object
	CHAR
  Description
	The class of a vertex is a feature always defined and independent of time (like the index). It is represented by an alphabetic character in upper or lower case (lower cases characters are considered different from upper cases). The label of a vertex is the string defined by the concatenation of its class and its index. The label thus provides general information about a vertex and enables us to encode the plant components.
