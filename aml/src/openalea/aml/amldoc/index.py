    Index of a vertex

    The `Index` of a vertex is a feature always defined and independent of time 
    (like the index). 
    It is represented by an by a non negative integer². 
    The label of a vertex is the string defined by the concatenation 
    of its class and its index. 
    The label thus provides general information about a vertex and 
    enables us to encode the plant components.
